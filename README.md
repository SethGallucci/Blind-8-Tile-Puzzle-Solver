Although the algorithm is essentially a brute-force algorithm, the purpose of it is not to be efficient, but to demonstrate that such problems are theoretically solvable even under such info-minimal conditions because of the specific way in which the problem is modeled.

In this model, a transformation is an attempt at swapping the contents of two neighboring spaces. Even though the destination state after applying any given transformation is unknown and *not definite*, applying the same transformation again results in the two-transformation action having an unknown but *definite* state. By keeping a record of the transformations applied to the puzzle, the state space can be explored, despite not knowing the current state of the puzzle, until the puzzle is in the solution state.

Another rather simple example is the familiar multi-wheel combination-lock. Here, rather than having each transformation be an involution, each transformation (movement of one of the wheels to the next symbol) is an order-n transformation (as in group theory, and n is usually 10 as a result of the digits 0-9), rather than an order-2 transformation (an involution). A key difference between the lock and the 8-tile puzzle is that the transformations of the lock commute (their order is insignificant), whereas the transformations of the 8-tile puzzle do not necessarily commute.
